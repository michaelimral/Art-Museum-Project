        "info": "\nOn April 15, 1912, the world’s largest luxury liner, Titanic, sank off the coast of Newfoundland; of the 2,200 passengers, 1,507 died. Beckmann was inspired by news accounts to produce this enormous canvas in which he focused on the lifeboats of the Titanic while placing the distant, brightly lit liner against an iron-red night sky. Beckmann sought to emulate a 19th-century French tradition of grand paintings of contemporary events. Here, his theme is the struggle for survival; boats list dangerously or have overturned. The largest lifeboat is crammed with women and children including one passenger still in her violet evening gown and earrings. Beckmann employs a palette of vibrant green and blue coloring to highlight the nightmarish quality of a scene in which ghostly heads can clearly be seen floating in the water.",

        "info": "\nIn this incandescent view animated by three sailboats, the sky is streaked with fuschia and mauve, and the setting sun is reflected on the sea. Emil Nolde’s landscape is probably informed by his memories of the South Seas, which he had visited the previous year. Nolde believed that intense colors could evoke sounds as well as deep emotion; he wrote of “colors in vibration, pealing like silver bells and clanging like bronze bells, proclaiming happiness, passion and love, soul, blood, and death.”",

Karl Schmidt-Rottluff’s mysterious work was inspired by the landscape around the Baltic coast of Germany. The artist represents his scene with vibrant, non-naturalistic colors: the mountain is rendered in intense red and magenta and the houses in ultramarine blue. Schmidt-Rottluff was the youngest member of Die Brücke (The Bridge) and focused largely on landscapes.",

Chestnut trees are in flower to the right and left, while two pair of women walk along the road. Vincent van Gogh’s work is of a compact, almost claustrophobic density and the sky is barely seen. In one of his final letters, Van Gogh described Auvers as “of a grave beauty, the real countryside, characteristic and picturesque.”",
